      <h1>About FitPal</h1>
      <p>
        <strong>FitPal</strong> is a browser-based AI fitness trainer that
        provides real-time feedback on bodyweight exercises using computer
        vision and pose estimation. Itâ€™s designed to help users improve form,
        count reps accurately, and stay motivatedâ€”all without additional
        hardware.
      </p>

      <h2>Meet the Developers</h2>
      <p>
        FitPal was created by a team of senior Computer Science students at Fisk
        University as part of their capstone project. Driven by a shared passion
        for AI, computer vision, and health technology, the team aimed to build
        an intelligent and accessible fitness companion. From architecture to
        implementation, each member contributed to designing the real-time
        tracking system, refining exercise logic, and building the frontend
        experience.
      </p>
